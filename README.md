# remarkable-tools
Custom tools for the remarkable tablet.

The following tools are proposed:
- a way to have a liveview of a page without using the cloud, by directly connecting to the tablet via SSH,
- a way to get an annotated pdf from the remarkable cloud (might get deprecated by "rmapi").

# Live view

You first, once, need to configure your `~/.ssh/config`:
~~~
Host remarkable
User root
HostName 10.11.99.1
# ^ this is via USB
# or e.g., for a home wifi: HostName 192.168.1.14
~~~

The tablet gives you its IP address in the settings panel in the "About" tab.
It also gives you the SSH password.
You should ideally create and setup SSH keys on the tablet to avoid typing the password every time.

Also, you need to install python3 with a few packages:
~~~
pip install asyncio
pip install websockets
~~~

If you don't have it (and if you annotated pdfs) you need to install `convert` (Image Magick).

Then:
~~~
./liveview/liveview.sh
~~~

It will:
- connect to the "remarkable" host via SSH using your keys,
- and, locally start a firefox to view the live document

You will need to restart the tablet once for the current page to be refreshed as soon as you change page on the tablet (without the restart, it changes only when you edit it).


# Attribution
These tools are partly built from the rm2svg tool:
- created here https://github.com/reHackable/maxio/
- forked here https://github.com/lschwetlick/maxio/tree/master/tools
- and made compatible with version 1.6 of the tablet here https://github.com/reHackable/maxio/issues/27

The pdf export script is inspired by https://github.com/jmptable/rm-dl-annotated
and uses https://github.com/juruen/rmapi (which needs to be installed and might even deprecate the current pdf export).
